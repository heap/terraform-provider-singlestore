# terraform-provider-singlestore

This is an unofficial fork of `winebarrel/mysql`, enhanced with support for Singlestore specific features.

Because this was a direct fork, it was forced to be "Public" which is incompatible with CS build standards and secret handling. A new repository was created with the history from this repository cloned into it: https://github.com/ContentSquare/terraform-provider-singlestore

**ALL FUTURE DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE CS COPY OF THE REPO**

## Older versions

Versions up to and including v2.0.18 are kept here as published artefacts that can continue to be accessed.

Version v2.0.19 onwards only exist in the new repository.

Also note, v2.0.19 is identical to v2.0.18 and merely exists as a transitional version.
